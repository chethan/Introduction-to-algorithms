I started watching the video lectures of the MIT course "Introduction to algorithms" : link -> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyuH4qXLZ0&playnext=1&list=PL8B24C31197EC371C

This repository is the collections of all exercises and algorithm implementations in Haskell, which i wrote during this course.
